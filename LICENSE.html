<a id="user-content-confidentiality" class="anchor" name="confidentiality" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Confidentiality:</h3>

<p><strong>Definition of Confidential Information.</strong> As used herein, “Confidential Information” means all confidential information disclosed by a party (“Disclosing Party”) to the other party (“Receiving Party”), whether orally or in writing, that is designated as confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the (a) terms of this Agreement, (b) the Swirl Resources, and (c) Swirl’s data, operations and underlying data shall constitute Confidential Information. However, Confidential Information will not include any information that (i) is or becomes generally known to the public without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, (ii) was known to the Receiving Party prior to its disclosure by the Disclosing Party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, (iii) is received from a third party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, or (iv) was independently developed by the Receiving Party. <br>
<strong>Protection of Confidential Information.</strong> The Receiving Party will use the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information only to exercise its rights or perform its obligations under this Agreement and will not disclose the Disclosing Party’s information to any third party except as reasonably necessary for such purposes. Except as otherwise permitted in writing by the Disclosing Party, (i) the Receiving Party will use the same degree of care that it uses to protect the confidentiality of its own confidential information of like kind (but in no event less than reasonable care) not to disclose or use any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party for any purpose outside the scope of this Agreement, and (ii) the Receiving Party will limit access to Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to those of its employees, contractors and agents who need such access for purposes consistent with this Agreement and who have signed confidentiality agreements with the Receiving Party containing protections no less stringent than those herein. <br>
<strong>Compelled Disclosure.</strong> The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party if it is compelled by law to do so, provided the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prior notice of such compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the Disclosing Party's cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure. If the Receiving Party is compelled by law to disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information as part of a civil proceeding to which the Disclosing Party is a party, and the Disclosing Party is not contesting the disclosure, the Disclosing Party will reimburse the Receiving Party for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure access to such Confidential Information. <br></p>

<a id="user-content-remedies" class="anchor" name="remedies" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Remedies:</h3>

<p>Each party agrees that the obligations it assumes under this Agreement are necessary and reasonable in order to protect the other party and its business and each party expressly stipulates that monetary damages may not be inadequate to compensate the other party for any breach by a party (or those for whom they are liable) of this Agreement. Accordingly, each party acknowledges and agrees that any such breach or threatened breach may cause irreparable injury to the other party and that, in addition to any other remedies that may be available in law, in equity or otherwise, without the necessity of proving actual damages or the need for the posting of a bond, a party may be entitled to obtain injunctive relief against the breach or threatened breach of this Agreement or the continuation of any such breach.</p>

<h3>
<a id="user-content-other-terms" class="anchor" name="other-terms" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Other Terms:</h3>

<p>If any portion of this Agreement is found to be unlawful, void or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever, the unenforceable provision will be deemed severable from this Agreement and will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement. This Agreement is the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior agreements and representations between You and Swirl. No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right under this Agreement will constitute a waiver of that right. Other than as expressly stated herein, the remedies provided herein are in addition to, and not exclusive of, any other remedies of a party at law or in equity. If Swirl must hire an attorney to enforce any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You agree to pay all reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs incurred by Swirl. This Agreement will be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, U.S.A. applicable to agreements made and to be performed in The Commonwealth of Massachusetts. You agree that any legal action or proceeding between You and Swirl for any purpose concerning this Agreement or the parties' obligations hereunder will be brought exclusively in a federal or state court of competent jurisdiction sitting in The Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The provisions of Section 3, 5, 6 and 8 and any other provisions which are by their nature intended to survive expiry or termination shall survive expiry or termination of this Agreement. </p>
